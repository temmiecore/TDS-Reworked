# TDS-Reworked
Rework of my first Unity project, called TDS.

TDS was made as my first attempt to learn Unity, and it was a little 5-minute top-down RPG. I proceeded to delete it, as I didn't deemed it worthy of internet light.
Now i've decided to remake it, and add a lot of new features: behaviour trees for enemy AIs, item systems, and basically use it as a testing ground for my ideas.
